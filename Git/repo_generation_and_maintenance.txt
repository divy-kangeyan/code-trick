git checkout correct branch

git stash apply

 

Rebasing to the master 

 

git checkout master

 

git pull

 

git checkout dkangeyan/DRAGEN-5723-randomUMIFix

 

git rebase master

 

Git will try to make the changes automatically, but it may get confused

It will tell you if it couldn't automatically add your changes to any files, and ask you to fix them

You'll usually see those as merge conflicts, where it will show you the code from master and 

your code together, and ask you to integrate them.

 

If it happens, make the changes and git add the file to mark the conflicted file as solved, 

and run "git rebase --continue"

 

git push -u origin branch_name

 

Delete a local branch

git branch -d localBranch


Updating local branch if the remote branch changes

git config remote.origin.url git_ssh_key


Remove a remote link
